# IoT-Based-Oximeter
This project is a real-time, IoT-enabled **pulse oximeter** that measures **heart rate (BPM)** and **blood oxygen level (SpOâ‚‚)** using the **MAX30100 sensor**. The values are displayed on a **0.96" OLED screen**, sent to the **Blynk app**, and also logged via the **Serial Monitor**.
